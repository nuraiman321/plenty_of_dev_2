## questions

1. pick a reasonable data type to represent this list in your program (you should've typed it out already, no more whinging)

2. word is spreading about this questionable site. ryan and maya also wants to join. write code to add ryan and maya to the list

3. dt was the one who leaked the list. Naturally he removed his own name. use a built in array function to remove the first element from the list.

4. loop through the members list and console log only the names that are 3 or 5 characters long each on a separate line
